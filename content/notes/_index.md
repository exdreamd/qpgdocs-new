>  Tugging at my soul  
>  The unknown days are shouting  
>  Programming,  
>  As the days go by.

> Of course  
>  I am the programmer,  
>  The beginning far away,  
>  The ending so very close.

> So I punch the card  
>  As time  
>  Connects the dots.  
>  And the unknown script?  
>  It’s just the present,  
>  Programming  
>  An unknown future.
